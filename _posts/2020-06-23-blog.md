## Why I made this

I'm going to be treating this blog as a journal for interesting skills I learn while I'm working on projects.
For this first one I'll mention some things I learned while setting this Jekyll blog up.

### The theme I used

I used a theme called [NexT](https://github.com/Simpleyyt/jekyll-theme-next). At some point I'm probably going to be making own one but I'm too lazy right now.

### The 404 page

There was a lotta garbage on the 404 page for this website. I noticed this when I added a <b>projects</b> menu item and didn't actually have a projects page ready yet.
I tried to restyle it with some free 404 page themes I found on the internet but the style sheet I made wasn't linking correctly. The stylesheet was in the same root directory.
I was doing this
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="404style.css">
```
When I should have been doing this
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/404style.css">
```
